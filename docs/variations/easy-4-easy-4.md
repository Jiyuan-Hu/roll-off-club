## Overview

Easy 4 + Easy 4, also known as "4 by 4", is the easiest roll off variation. To time it out, you simply start on orange, jump 4 times, switch to blue, and then again jump 4 times.

The standard path is to jump 4 times on orange, transfer to blue just before the first wall on orange and after the 2nd wall on blue, and then jump 4 times on blue. This path can be done all 12 laps.

Beginning with the 9th lap, it can be useful to start with 3 jumps on orange instead. By transfering to blue earlier, you give more space for others to follow behind.
