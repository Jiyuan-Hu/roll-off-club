# Isolated Duo + Isolated Duo

![Isolated Duo + Isolated Duo](../images/variations/isolated-duo-isolated-duo.jpg)

## Overview

[Isolated Duo](../rolls/isolated-duo.md#orange) + [Isolated Duo](../rolls/isolated-duo.md#blue) has a very simple path but can get tricky to timeout with a large number of players. Remember that the 2nd long jump on orange and the 1st long jump on blue are both [god jumps](../advanced/isolated-duo-god-jumps.md), so be sure to avoid them if you haven't practiced. That said, if you have practiced them, making use of these god jumps can be a clever way to avoid desync in the middle.
