# Variations

This section gives an in-depth analysis of the 20 different Roll Off variations.

!!! note

    It is *highly recommended* to read through the [getting started](../getting-started/index.md)
    section before learning the specifics of individual variations. In particular, is is very important
    to be familiar with the different [roll patterns](../getting-started/learning-the-rolls.md) and 
    to know that the blue roll spins [slightly faster](../getting-started/blue-spins-faster-than-orange.md)
    than the orange roll. With this knowledge, many of the variations can be timed out intuitively without
    needing to memorize paths for each of the individual variations.

## Hardest variations

These are the hardest of all 20 Roll Off variations. Memorizing paths ahead of time is recommended to consistently survive on these variations.

* [5 Waller + Grand Canyon](./5-waller-grand-canyon.md)
* [5 Waller + Open-Closed](./5-waller-open-closed.md)
* [Closed-Open + Grand Canyon](./closed-open-grand-canyon.md)
* [Closed-Open + Open-Closed](./closed-open-open-closed.md)
* [Isolated Duo + Grand Canyon](./isolated-duo-grand-canyon.md)

## Hard variations

While not the hardest, these variations can still be somewhat difficult, especially with many players still alive in the last couple minutes of the timeout.

* [Easy 4 + Grand Canyon](./easy-4-grand-canyon.md)
* [Easy 4 + Open-Closed](./easy-4-open-closed.md)
* [5 Waller + Easy 4](./5-waller-easy-4.md)
* [5 Waller + Isolated Duo](./5-waller-isolated-duo.md)
* [5 Waller + Pillar Trench](./5-waller-pillar-trench.md)

## Medium variations

These variations are not too difficult if you have learned [the basics](../getting-started/index.md), but may be prone to desync with a large number of players. Memorizing paths is *not required* for these variations. However, memorizing [the rolls](../rolls/index.md) is encouraged.

* [Closed-Open + Easy 4](./closed-open-easy-4.md)
* [Closed-Open + Isolated Duo](./closed-open-isolated-duo.md)
* [Closed-Open + Pillar Trench](./closed-open-pillar-trench.md)
* [Easy 4 + Pillar Trench](./easy-4-pillar-trench.md)
* [Isolated Duo + Isolated Duo](./isolated-duo-isolated-duo.md)

## Easy variations

These are the easiest Roll Off variations to timeout, containing lots of open space and multiple different pathing options. Memorizing paths is *not required* for these variations. However, memorizing [the rolls](../rolls/index.md) is encouraged.

* [Easy 4 + Easy 4](./easy-4-easy-4.md)
* [Easy 4 + Isolated Duo](./easy-4-isolated-duo.md)
* [Isolated Duo + Easy 4](./isolated-duo-easy-4.md)
* [Isolated Duo + Open-Closed](./isolated-duo-open-closed)
* [Isolated Duo + Pillar Trench](./isolated-duo-pillar-trench.md)
