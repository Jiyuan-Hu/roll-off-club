# Isolated Duo + Pillar Trench

![Isolated Duo + Pillar Trench](../images/variations/isolated-duo-pillar-trench.jpg)

## Overview

[Isolated Duo](../rolls/isolated-duo.md#orange) + [Pillar Trench](../rolls/pillar-trench.md) is flexible in terms of where you want to be late in the timeout. However, due to the large gaps on orange, you don't get as much space to work with, so you're mostly forced to be on the blue side. You can either take the 3 jumps in the middle of blue, or transfer between the two rolls. The trickiest part about this variation is that they both end with walls really close to each other with a small gap, so it's important to give space for others when making pathing decisions.
