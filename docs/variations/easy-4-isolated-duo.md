# Easy 4 + Isolated Duo

![Easy 4 + Isolated Duo](../images/variations/easy-4-isolated-duo.jpg)

## Overview

[Easy 4](../rolls/easy-4.md#orange) + [Isolated Duo](../rolls/isolated-duo.md#blue) is a relatively easy variation, due to the amount of free space at the start of orange. Remember that the 1st long jump on blue is a [god jump](../advanced/isolated-duo-god-jumps.md), so be sure to stay on orange if you aren't comfortable executing it.
