# Closed-Open + Pillar Trench

![Closed-Open + Pillar Trench](../images/variations/closed-open-pillar-trench.jpg)

## Overview

[Closed-Open](../rolls/closed-open-open-closed.md#orange) + [Pillar Trench](../rolls/pillar-trench.md) starts off with confined space at the beginning of each lap. However, it becomes more flexible at the end with 3 jumps in the center of blue and 3 jumps at the end of orange. Because orange has 2 starting jumps, it's advised when it's late that you start off on this side and try to work your way to blue, then decide if you want to stay on blue or go back to orange.
