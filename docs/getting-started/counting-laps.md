# Counting Laps

## Overview

We refer to a "lap" as a full 360 degree rotation of a ring in roll off. During a 5 minute timeout, each ring will rotate 12 times, meaning that there are 12 laps in a timeout.

Counting laps can be helpful to understand what paths to take during a timeout, especially for the harder variations.

## Lap times

| Lap # | Start time | Duration |
| ----- | ---------- | -------- |
| 1     | 0:00       | 0:47     |
| 2     | 0:47       | 0:32     |
| 3     | 1:16       | 0:29     |
| 4     | 1:41       | 0:25     |
| 5     | 2:05       | 0:24     |
| 6     | 2:28       | 0:23     |
| 7     | 2:51       | 0:23     |
| 8     | 3:12       | 0:22     |
| 9     | 3:33       | 0:21     |
| 10    | 3:54       | 0:21     |
| 11    | 4:15       | 0:21     |
| 12    | 4:36       | 0:21     |

## Useful tips

If you play with Fall Guys music, you can easily detect the start of lap 7 by listening for when the background music starts looping for the second time.

By lap 9 the slime has reached it's maximum height, meaning the last 4 laps of a timeout will typically be the hardest.
