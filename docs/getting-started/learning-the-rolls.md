# Learning the Rolls

Learning the different possible orange and blue Roll patterns you can get is the **single most important thing you can do to improve your consistency in Roll Off**.

Having a familiarity with the roll patterns before you start playing has several benefits:

* It makes it easier to determine a path late in the timeout.
* It allows you to focus more on avoiding desync.
* It makes it easier for you to avoid griefers.

Learning the rolls is something that you will pick up naturally through practice. I recommend taking a clip of each Roll Off final you play and analyzing it afterwards and see if you can identify the orange and blue rolls yourself and over time you'll be able to identify them quickly. If you find memorizing all of the roll patterns overwhelming at first, try memorizing only the important characteristics of each to start (such as the areas where there are multiple easy jumps in a row, etc.).

An overview of each roll is given below:
