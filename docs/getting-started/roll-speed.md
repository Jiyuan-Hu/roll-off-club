# Blue Spins Faster Than Orange

It is extremely important to understand that **the blue roll spins slightly faster than the orange roll** throughout the duration of a Roll Off timeout. These different speeds mean that the rolls will align differently each lap.

!!! tip

    If you find yourself consistently dying late in a Roll Off timeout, it could be
    because you aren't taking into account the fact that blue spins faster than orange,
    which causes the alignment to change.

For example, the picture below shows how the blue and orange rolls align for the last 4 laps of a timeout. Notice how the orange roll aligns differently relative to the blue roll after each lap. This is because blue spins slightly faster relative than orange, causing the alignment to change each lap. In this case, it means that the transfer from blue to orange gets slightly more difficult with each lap.

Many players focus all of their energy on memorizing a single path to take early in the timeout. However, because they fail to take the different speeds into account, they are suddenly surprised when the path they have memorized suddenly doesn't work and they die because of it.

My recommendation is to visualize what the current path you are taking will look like on the next lap.

For example, in the clip below I notice that the transfer from blue to orange is extremely tight. Since blue spins faster than orange, I know on the next lap that transfer will be even more difficult (and maybe even impossible).

As a result, I know that on the next lap I will need to find a new path instead.
