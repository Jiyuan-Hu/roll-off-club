## 学习滚轮版型

熟悉滚轮版型会让你能够随时变换路线以避开闸总。

## 不要过早吸引注意

远离闸总且不要给自己吸引注意。更多地关注滚轮版型和路线规划。
Stay out of the way early on and don't draw attention to yourself. Just focus on the roll patterns and your own pathing. Most griefers spend so much time trying to kill other players early on that they neglect to memorize the roll patterns, so by the time the slime rises and the rolls get faster, they panic and die.

## Kill the griefer

You can push the griefer into a gap:

</video>

You can pants a griefer before they jump a gap:

<video controls>
  <source src="../../images/getting-started/avoiding-griefers/pantsing-a-griefer.mp4" type="video/mp4">
</video>

It is easier to kill griefers when you surprise them, so try not to draw attention to yourself early on and they won't suspect it.

## One-rolling

You can one-roll to avoid a griefer:

</video>

!!! warning

    Avoid one-rolling early on in the timeout, as it will draw attention to yourself and
    make it more likely that griefers will focus on killing you.

## Other TODOs

Still need clips/examples of these strategies:

* Jump early to cancel grabs
* Switching to the opposite roll
    * Example: <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ijl9Lo8jsDw> (need better example?)
* Drawing them out to the edge
* Avoid jumping when griefers nearby
* Bunny hop on roll off to avoid griefers similar to jump showdown
* Stay out of the way and don't draw attention to yourself at the start when dealing with griefers
