# Understanding Roll Speed

* One of the most important things to realize is that the blue roll spins slightly faster than the orange roll.
* This means the alignment of the two rolls will change throughout a timeout.
* For example, a path that you take 3:30 into a timeout may no longer be possible at 4:30 into a timeout.
* My recommendation is to visualize what the current path you are taking will look like on the next lap. For example, if a transfer from blue to orange feels tight on lap 9, then realize that since blue is spinning slightly faster than orange, that transfer may no longer be possible on the next lap, meaning you will likely have to change your path.
