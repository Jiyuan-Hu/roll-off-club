# Reducing Desync

Here are some tips for avoiding collisions during Roll Off.

Remember that in order to timeout, you need to also make sure others survive as well.

## Learn the roll patterns

Learning the roll patterns will allow you to focus less of your energy on your own path and more of your energy on avoiding desync with other players.

## Prefer jumps over transfers

Most desync occurs when 2 players transfer between the two rolls at the same time and accidentally run into each other.

An easy way to avoid this is by jumping instead of transfering whenever possible. This will keep you out of the center where collisions are more likely to occur.

Some examples of where jumping is usually the safer alternative are:

* The 3 jumps in the middle of [Pillar Trench](../rolls/pillar-trench.md)
* The 3 jumps in the middle of [Grand Canyon](../rolls/grand-canyon.md)
* The 3 jumps in the middle of [Isolated Duo](../rolls/isolated-duo.md)
* The 3 jumps at the start of [Closed-Open Orange](../rolls/closed-open-open-closed.md)
* The 3 jumps at the end of [Open-Closed Blue](../rolls/closed-open-open-closed.md)
* The 4 jumps at the start of [Easy 4 Orange](../rolls/easy-4.md)
* The 4 jumps at the end of [Easy 4 Blue](../rolls/easy-4.md)

Note that this advice only applies when no other beans are nearby. If another bean is within grabbing distance, you should prefer transfering instead to avoid getting pantsed.

## Transfer early to give space for others

Try to transfer across rolls as early as possible. The longer you wait to transfer, the more likely it becomes that you will body block someone behind you.

When you do transfer, be sure that you also provide players behind you with enough space.

## Try to maintain consistent pathing

While changing your path is sometimes necessary, keeping the changes at a minimum will reduce the likelihood of surprising someone else.

## Avoid transfering to the same small ledge as someone else

Transfering to the same small ledge as someone else is very dangerous and should be avoided if possible. Keep an eye out for what others are doing during the timeout and try to plan ahead if you notice someone transfering to a small ledge.

## Avoid jumping in front of others

Jumping in front of others is very dangerous for the other players as it puts them at risk of being body blocked or simply losing the momentum required for the jump.
