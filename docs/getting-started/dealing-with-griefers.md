# Dealing with Griefers

* Learn the roll patterns
* Jump early to cancel grabs
* Switching to the opposite roll
    * Example: <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ijl9Lo8jsDw> (need better example?)
* Drawing them out to the edge
* One roll (only do it late)
    * Example: <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vn8grM0pXWI>
* Pants or push them (element of surprise)
    * Example: <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=er8i3LFaCSM>
* Avoid jumping when griefers nearby
* Bunny hop on roll off to avoid griefers similar to jump showdown
* Stay out of the way and don't draw attention to yourself at the start when dealing with griefers
