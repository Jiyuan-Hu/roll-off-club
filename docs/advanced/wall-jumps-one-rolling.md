## One-roll timeouts

One-rolling is the act of staying on the same roll for all 12 laps of a timeout, done by jumping around the right side of the walls of the roll. It is possible to one-roll all rolls except [Grand Canyon Blue](../rolls/grand-canyon.md).

Below are example one roll timeouts to use as reference:
