# Recognizing Variations

!!! note

    Beginning with SS4 released in May 2023, the Roll Off introduction scenes have changed, making
    some of the information in this page less useful for detecting variations.

It is possible to detect the exact Roll Off variation from the preview at the start of the final. This can be convenient so that you don't have to spend the first lap trying to figure out which variation you have gotten.

Below is a simple decision tree that you can use to detect each of the orange and blue rolls from the final's opening preview.

## Rolls

The strategies you can use to detect each roll early on are described below.

### 5 Waller

To differentiate it from Grand Canyon, check that the roll has oranged striped inner edges and a purple bar.

## Other tips

[Isolated Duo](../rolls/isolated-duo.md) Blue can be recognized early by its purple edge color, as it is the only blue roller with purple edges.

![Isolated Duo Blue](../images/advanced/recognizing-variants/isolated-duo-blue-side-view.jpg)

Similarly, [Open-Closed](../rolls/closed-open-open-closed.md) Blue can be recognized early by its gold edge color, as it is the only blue roller with gold edges.
