The "Grand Canyon" roll gets its name from the huge gap at the start.

### What to remember

* **The huge gap at the start is impossible to jump.** This means you will be forced to stay on orange while this gap passes on blue.
* **The middle has 3 straightforward jumps.** Most variations you'll want to take advantage of this space to avoid desync with other beans transfering in the center.
