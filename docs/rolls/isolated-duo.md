# Isolated Duo

The "Isolated Duo" rolls get their name from the 2 small platforms that lie in the middle.

The orange and blue rolls are mirror images of each other, yet the patterns on both are identical.

## Orange

### What to remember

* **The 1st long jump is EASY to execute.** This gap is easy to make with a simple jump dive and can be useful to avoid desync with other beans transfering in the center.
* **The 2nd long jump is HARD to execute.** While possible, be sure to [practice](../advanced/isolated-duo-god-jumps.md) this jump beforehand as it requires a very specific setup late in the timeout.

## Blue
