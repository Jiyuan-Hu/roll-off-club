The "Pillar Trench" roll gets its name from its 12 pillars, the most of any roll.

### What to remember

* **Starts with 2 walls in a row w/o gaps.**  Most variations you'll want to start on orange to avoid the lack of space caused by these two walls.
* **The middle has 3 straightforward jumps.** Most variations you'll want to take advantage of this space to avoid desync with other beans transfering in the center.
