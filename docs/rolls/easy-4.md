This variation gets its name for having 4 easy, straightforward jumps at the beginning. It's a flipped variation of the blue Easy 4, and has the beginning blue ends off with. This is by far considered the easiest orange variant to traverse on due to how small the gaps are and how spacious it is. There is not a single gap you need to worry about diving on, and each jump can be made relatively easily.

At the beginning, there are 4 consecutive jumps you can make, then after this there is a wall, with 3 platforms surrounding another wall that has 2 small gaps.
