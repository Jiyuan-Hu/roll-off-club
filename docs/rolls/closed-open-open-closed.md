The reason this roller gets its name "Closed-Open" is for having a confined start and an open ending. Out of all the orange variants, this one roller has the most spacious ending to traverse. This is the only variant that allows for three late jumps without any dives needed.

## Blue

The reason this roller gets its name "Open-Closed" is for having an open start and a closed ending. Out of all the blue variants, this roller has the most open beginning and the most confined ending, giving barely enough space to traverse it. This is the only blue variant that allows three early jumps until its middle section. Each jump can be made even without a dive, including the last one.
