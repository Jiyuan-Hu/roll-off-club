# Closed-Open & Open-Closed

The orange and blue rolls are mirror images of each other, yet the patterns on both are identical.

## Orange

The "Closed-Open" roll gets its name is for having a confined start and an open ending.

### What to remember

* **Ends with 3 jumps.** Most variations you'll want to end on orange to take advantage of this space.
* **There is a large gap in the middle.** It's straightforward to jump dive across this gap. However, it may be smarter to stay on blue to avoid it.

## Blue
