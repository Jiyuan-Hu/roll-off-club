## Orange

![5 Waller Orange](../images/rolls/5-waller-orange-annotated.jpg)

This roll gets its name for having the most walls out of all the 9 roll, having a total of 5, hence its name.

This roll, while mostly confined due to how many walls there are, is known to have created some of the hardest variations due to how little space you're given late game. With this roll, it is highly unlikely you will be receiving a huge timeout.
