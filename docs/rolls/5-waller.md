![5 Waller Orange](../images/rolls/5-waller-orange-annotated.jpg)

This roll gets its name for having the most walls out of all rolls with a total of 5.

### What to remember

* **The 5 walls on this roll provide very little free space.** Try your best to stay on blue if possible, as transfering to or from the 5 Waller roll can very easily cause desync with other players.
